Consider the expression
for (n1 <- Future { Thread.sleep(1000) ; 2 }
n2 <- Future { Thread.sleep(1000); 40 })
println(n1 + n2)
How is the expression translated to map and flatMap calls? Are the two futures executed
concurrently or one after the other? In which thread does the call to println occur?
Answer:
one by one - consistently.
println occur -any another thread
