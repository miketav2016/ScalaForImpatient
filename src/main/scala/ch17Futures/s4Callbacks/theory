As already mentioned, one does not usually use a blocking wait to get the result of a future. For better
performance, the future should report its result to a callback function.
***
There are callback methods onSuccess and onFailure that are only called on success or
failure of a future. However, these are deprecated because they are even bigger contributors to
callback hell.
