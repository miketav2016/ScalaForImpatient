A better way of modeling such trees is with case classes. Letâ€™s start with binary trees.
sealed abstract class BinaryTree
case class Leaf(value: Int) extends BinaryTree
case class Node(left: BinaryTree, right: BinaryTree) extends BinaryTree
Write a function to compute the sum of all elements in the leaves.
