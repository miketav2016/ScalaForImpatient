Add a case class Multiple that is a subclass of the Item class. For example,
Multiple(10, Article("Blackwell Toaster", 29.95)) describes ten
toasters. Of course, you should be able to handle any items, such as bundles or multiples, in the
second argument. Extend the price function to handle this new case.
