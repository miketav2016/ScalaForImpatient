Write a function that composes two functions of type Double => Option[Double],
yielding another function of the same type. The composition should yield None if either
function does. For example,
def f(x: Double) = if (x != 1) Some(1 / (x - 1)) else None
def g(x: Double) = if (x >= 0) Some(sqrt(x)) else None
val h = compose(g, f) // h(x) should be g(f(x))
Then h(2) is Some(1), and h(1) and h(0) are None.
