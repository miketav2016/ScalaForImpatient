Extend the tree in the preceding exercise so that each nonleaf node stores an operator in
addition to the child nodes. Then write a function eval that computes the value. For example,
the tree
     +
    /|\
   * 2 -
  / \   |
  3 8   5
has value (3 × 8) + 2 + (–5) = 21.
Pay attention to the unary minus
