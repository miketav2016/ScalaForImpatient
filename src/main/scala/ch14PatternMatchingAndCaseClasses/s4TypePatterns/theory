When you match against a type, you must supply a variable name. Otherwise, you match the
object:

obj match {
case _: BigInt => Int.MaxValue // Matches any object of type BigInt
case BigInt => -1 // Matches the BigInt object of type Class

Matches occur at runtime, and generic types are erased in the Java virtual machine. For that
reason, you cannot make a type match for a specific Map type.

case m: Map[String, Int] => ... // Don't
You can match a generic map:
case m: Map[_, _] => ... // OK
However, arrays are not erased. You can match an Array[Int].
