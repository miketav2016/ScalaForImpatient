A set of case clauses enclosed in braces is a partial functionâ€”a function which may not be defined
for all inputs. It is an instance of a class PartialFunction[A, B]. (A is the parameter type, B
the return type.) That class has two methods: apply, which computes the function value from the
matching pattern, and isDefinedAt, which returns true if the input matches at least one of the
patterns.
The partial function expression must be in a context where the compiler can infer the return type. This
is the case when you assign it to a typed variable or pass it as an argument.
