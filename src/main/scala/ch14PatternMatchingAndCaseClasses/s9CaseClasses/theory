When you declare a case class, several things happen automatically.
• Each of the constructor parameters becomes a val unless it is explicitly declared as a var
(which is not recommended).
• An apply method is provided for the companion object that lets you construct objects without
new, such as Dollar(29.95) or Currency(29.95, "EUR").
• An unapply method is provided that makes pattern matching work—see Chapter 11 for the
details. (You don’t really need to know these details to use case classes for pattern matching.)
• Methods toString, equals, hashCode, and copy are generated unless they are
explicitly provided.
