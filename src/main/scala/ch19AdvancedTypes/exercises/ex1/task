Implement a Bug class modeling a bug that moves along a horizontal line. The move method
moves in the current direction, the turn method makes the bug turn around, and the show
method prints the current position. Make these methods chainable. For example,

bugsy.move(4).show().move(6).show().turn().move(5).show()
should display 4 10 5.
