The generic type List depends on a type T and produces a type. For example, given the type Int,
you get the type List[Int]. For that reason, a generic type such as List is sometimes called a
type constructor. In Scala, you can go up another level and define types that depend on types that
depend on types.

***
To use higher-kinded types without a warning, add the statement import
scala.language.higherKinds or use the compiler option -
language:higherKinds.
