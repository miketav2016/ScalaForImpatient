It is a challenge to model families of types that vary together, share common code, and preserve type
safety. For example, consider event handling in client-side Java. There are different types of events
(such as ActionEvent, ChangeEvent, and so on). Each type has a separate listener interface
(ActionListener, ChangeListener, and so on). This is an example of “family
polymorphism.”
