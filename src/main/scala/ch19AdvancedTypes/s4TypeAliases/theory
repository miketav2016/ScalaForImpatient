You can create a simple alias for a complicated type with the type keyword.
!!!A type alias must be nested inside a class or object!!!
However, in the REPL, you can declare a type at the top level, since everything in the REPL is
implicitly contained in a top-level object.

The type keyword is also used for abstract types that are made concrete in a subclass,
see abstract class Reader.
