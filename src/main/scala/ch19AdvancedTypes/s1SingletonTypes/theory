Given any reference v, you can form the type v.type, which has two values: v and null. This
sounds like a curious type, but it has a couple of useful applications.
1. consider a method that returns this so you can chain method calls
   see class Document,Book and object SingletonTypes
2.You can also use a singleton type if you want to define a method that takes an object instance as
  parameter. You may wonder why you would ever want to do that—after all, if there is just one
  instance, the method could simply use it instead of making the caller pass it.
  However, some people like to construct “fluent interfaces” that read like English o_O!
