The Scala language reference gives an exhaustive list of all Scala types, which is reproduced in
ScalaTypes.png , with brief explanations for each type.
This table shows the types that you, the programmer, can declare. There are a few types that the
Scala compiler uses internally. For example, a method type is denoted by (T1, ..., Tn)T
without a =>. You will occasionally see such types. For example, when you enter
def square(x: Int) = x * x
in the Scala REPL, it responds with
square (x: Int)Int
This is different from
val triple = (x: Int) => 3 * x
which yields
triple: Int => Int
You can turn a method into a function by appending a _. The type of
square _
is Int => Int.
