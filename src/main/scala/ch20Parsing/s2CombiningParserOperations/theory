To use the Scala parsing library, provide a class that extends the Parsers trait and defines parsing
operations that are combined from primitive operations, such as
• Matching a token
• Choosing between two operations (|)
• Performing two operations in sequence (~)
• Repeating an operation (rep)
• Optionally performing an operation (opt)
