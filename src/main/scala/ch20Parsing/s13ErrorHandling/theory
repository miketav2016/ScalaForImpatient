The parser generates an error message that describes the position at which the parser was unable to
continue. If there were several failure points, the one that was visited last is reported.
You may want to keep error reporting in mind when you order alternatives.
The failure combinator only reports an error when it is visited. It does not change the error
messages that another combinator reports.
