If a parser function calls itself without first consuming some input, the recursion will never stop.
Consider this function that is supposed to consume any sequence of ones:

def ones: Parser[Any] = ones ~ "1" | "1"
Such a function is called left-recursive. To avoid the recursion, you can reformulate the grammar.
Here are two alternatives:

def ones: Parser[Any] = "1" ~ ones | "1"
or

def ones: Parser[Any] = rep1("1")
