The RegexParsers trait, which we have used in all examples up to this point, provides two
implicit conversions for defining parsers:
• literal makes a Parser[String] from a literal string (such as "+").
• regex makes a Parser[String] from a regular expression (such as "[0-9]".r).

The JavaTokenParsers trait extends RegexParsers and specifies five tokens, shown in
png. None of them correspond exactly to their Java forms, which makes that trait of limited
utility.
