There is no particular significance to the ^^ symbol. It conveniently has lower precedence than
~ but higher precedence than |.

***
If you turn off the warning against postfix operators, you can write p? instead of opt(p) and
p* instead of rep(p):

def expr: Parser[Any] = term ~ (("+" | "-") ~ expr)?
def term: Parser[Any] = factor ~ ("*" ~ factor)*
It seems a good idea to use these familiar operators, but they conflict with the ^^ operator.
Youâ€™ll have to add another set of parentheses, such as

def term: Parser[Any] = factor ~ (("*" ~ factor)*) ^^ { ... }
For that reason, I prefer opt and rep.
