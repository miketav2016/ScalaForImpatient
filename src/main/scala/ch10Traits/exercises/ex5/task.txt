The JavaBeans specification has the notion of a property change listener, a standardized way
for beans to communicate changes in their properties. The PropertyChangeSupport class
is provided as a convenience superclass for any bean that wishes to support property change
listeners. Unfortunately, a class that already has another superclass—such as JComponent—
must reimplement the methods. Reimplement PropertyChangeSupport as a trait, and mix
it into the java.awt.Point class.
