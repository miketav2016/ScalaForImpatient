Construct an example where a class needs to be recompiled when one of the mixins changes.
Start with class SavingsAccount extends Account with ConsoleLogger.
Put each class and trait in a separate source file. Add a field to Account. In Main (also in a
separate source file), construct a SavingsAccount and access the new field. Recompile all
files except for SavingsAccount and verify that the program works. Now add a field to
ConsoleLogger and access it in Main. Again, recompile all files except for
SavingsAccount. What happens? Why?
