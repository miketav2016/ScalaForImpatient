Look through the methods of the Iterable[+A] trait. Which methods use the type parameter
A? Why is it in a covariant position in these methods?

The + means that the type is covariant in Tâ€”that is, it varies in the same direction.

type Iterable[+A] = scala.collection.Iterable[A]

trait Iterable[+A] extends IterableOnce[A]

method: head, last,
