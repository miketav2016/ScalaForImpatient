A view bound T <% V requires the existence of an implicit conversion from T to V. A context
bound has the form T : M, where M is another generic type. It requires that there is an “implicit
value” of type M[T].
For example,
class Pair[T : Ordering]
requires that there is an implicit value of type Ordering[T]. That implicit value can then be used
in the methods of the class. When you declare a method that uses the implicit value, you have to add
an “implicit parameter.”
