Sometimes, you need to place restrictions on type variables. Consider a Pair type where both
components have the same type.
=> see PairS3

T <: Comparable[T]  - it's means that Comparable[T] is a upper bound for T

In general, the replacement type must be a supertype of the pairâ€™s component type.
R >: T  - it's means that R is a lower bound for T

Now we can instantiate Pair[java.lang.String] but not Pair[java.net.URL], since
String is a subtype of Comparable[String] but URL does not implement
Comparable[URL].
