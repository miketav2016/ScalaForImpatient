A type variable can have both an upper and a lower bound. The syntax is this:
T >: Lower <: Upper
You canâ€™t have multiple upper or lower bounds. However, you can still require that a type
implements multiple traits, like this:

T <: Comparable[T] with Serializable with Cloneable
You can have more than one context bound:
T : Ordering : ClassTag
