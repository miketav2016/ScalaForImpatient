Explain why Ordering is a type class and why Ordered is not.

answer:
A trait such as Ordering is called a type class. A type class defines some behavior, and a type can
join the class by providing that behavior.
The standard Scala library provides useful type classes, such as Equiv, Ordering, Numeric,
Fractional, Hashing, IsTraversableOnce, IsTraversableLike.
Ordered is not in standard.
