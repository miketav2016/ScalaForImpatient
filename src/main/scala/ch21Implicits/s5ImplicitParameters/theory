A function or method can have a parameter list that is marked implicit. In that case, the compiler
will look for default values to supply with the function call.
***
There can only be one implicit value for a given data type. Thus, it is not a good idea to use
implicit parameters of common types. For example,

def quote(what: String)(implicit left: String, right: String) // No!
would not workâ€”one could not supply two different strings.
