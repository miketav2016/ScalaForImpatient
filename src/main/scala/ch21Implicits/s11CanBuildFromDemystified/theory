In the Scala library, map is actually defined in the TraversableLike[A, Repr] trait.
That way, the more commonly used Iterable trait doesnâ€™t need to carry with it the Repr
type parameter.


As you just saw, the implicit CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That] parameter locates a factory
object that can produce a builder for the target collection. The builder factory is defined as implicit in
the companion object of Repr.
