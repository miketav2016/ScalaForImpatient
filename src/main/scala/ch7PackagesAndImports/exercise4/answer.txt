Q:Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the package object syntax instead of simply letting you add functions and variables to a package?
A:Thatâ€™s an unfortunate limitation of the Java virtual machine.
A package can contain classes, objects, and traits, but not the definitions of functions or variables.
It would make more sense to add utility functions or constants to a package than to some Utils object. Package objects address this limitation.
