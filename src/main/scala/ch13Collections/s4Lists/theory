In Scala, a list is either Nil (that is, empty) or an object with a head element and a tail that is
again a list.
If you want to mutate list elements in place, you can use a ListBuffer, a data structure that is
backed by a linked list with a reference to the last node. This makes it efficient to add or remove
elements at either end of the list.However, adding or removing elements in the middle is not efficient.
