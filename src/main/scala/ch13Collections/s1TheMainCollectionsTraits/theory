A Seq is an ordered sequence of values, such as an array or list. An IndexedSeq allows fast
random access through an integer index. For example, an ArrayBuffer is indexed but a linked list
is not.
A Set is an unordered collection of values. In a SortedSet, elements are always visited in sorted
order.
A Map is a set of (key, value) pairs. A SortedMap visits the entries as sorted by the keys.
Each Scala collection trait or class has a companion object with an apply method for constructing
an instance of the collection.
There are methods toSeq, toSet, toMap, and so on, as well as a generic to[C] method, that you
can use to translate between collection types.
