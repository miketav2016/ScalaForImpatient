The key points of this chapter are:
• All collections extend the Iterable trait.
• The three major categories of collections are sequences, sets, and maps.
• Scala has mutable and immutable versions of most collections.
• A Scala list is either empty, or it has a head and a tail which is again a list.
• Sets are unordered collections.
• Use a LinkedHashSet to retain the insertion order or a SortedSet to iterate in sorted
order.
• + adds an element to an unordered collection; +: and :+ prepend or append to a sequence; ++
concatenates two collections; - and -- remove elements.
• The Iterable and Seq traits have dozens of useful methods for common operations. Check
them out before writing tedious loops.
• Mapping, folding, and zipping are useful techniques for applying a function or operation to the
elements of a collection.
