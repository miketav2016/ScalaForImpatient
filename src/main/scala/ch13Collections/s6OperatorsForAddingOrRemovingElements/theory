Generally, + is used for adding an element to an unordered collection, while +: and :+ add an
element to the beginning or end of an ordered collection.
Note that +:, like all operators ending in a colon, is right-associative, and that it is a method of the
right operand.
Mutable collections have a += operator that mutates the left-hand side.
1. Append (:+) or prepend (+:) to a sequence.
2. Add (+) to an unordered collection.
3. Remove with the - operator.
4. Use ++ and -- for bulk add and remove.
5. Mutations are += ++= -= --=.
6. For lists, many Scala programmers prefer the :: and ::: operators.
7. Stay away from ++: +=: ++=:.
For lists, you can use +: instead of :: for consistency, with one exception: Pattern matching
(case h::t) does not work with the +: operator.
