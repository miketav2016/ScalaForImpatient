A set is a collection of distinct elements. Trying to add an existing element has no effect. For
example,
Set(2, 0, 1) + 1
is the same as Set(2, 0, 1).
Unlike lists, sets do not retain the order in which elements are inserted. By default, sets are
implemented as hash sets in which elements are organized by the value of the hashCode method.
Finding an element in a hash set is much faster than in an array or list.
The union, intersect, and diff methods carry out the usual set operations. If you prefer, you
can write them as |, &, and &~. You can also write union as ++ and difference as --.
