You may want to transform all elements of a collection. The map method applies a function to a
collection and yields a collection of the results.
If the function yields a collection instead of a single value, you may want to concatenate all results. In
that case, use flatMap.
flatMap = Map + Flatten
If you use flatMap with a function that returns an Option, the resulting collection contains
all values v for which the function returns Some(v).
