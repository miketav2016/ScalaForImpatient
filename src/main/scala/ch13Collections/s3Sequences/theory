    A Vector is the immutable equivalent of an ArrayBuffer: an indexed sequence with fast random
access.Vectors are implemented as trees where each node has up to 32 children. For a vector with
one million elements, one needs four layers of nodes. (Since 10^3 » 2^10, 10^6 » 32^4.) Accessing an
element in such a list will take 4 hops, whereas in a linked list it would take an average of 500,000.
    A Range represents an integer sequence, such as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10,20,30. Of
course a Range object doesn’t store all sequence values but only the start, end, and increment.
