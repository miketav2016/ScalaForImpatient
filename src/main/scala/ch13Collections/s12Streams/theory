 Each call to next mutates the iterator. Streams offer an immutable
alternative. A stream is an immutable list in which the tail is computed lazilyâ€”that is, only when you
ask for it.
You can construct a stream from an iterator. For example, the Source.getLines method returns
an Iterator[String]. With that iterator, you can only visit the lines once
