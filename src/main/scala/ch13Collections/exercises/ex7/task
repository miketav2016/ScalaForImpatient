In Section 13.10, “Zipping,” on page 187, the expression (prices zip quantities)
map { p => p._1 * p._2 } is a bit inelegant. We can’t do (prices zip
quantities) map { _ * _ } because _ * _ is a function with two arguments, and
we need a function with one argument that is a tuple. The tupled method of the Function
object changes a function with two arguments to one that takes a tuple. Apply tupled to the
multiplication function so you can map it over the list of pairs.
