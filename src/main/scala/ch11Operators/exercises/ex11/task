Improve the dynamic property selector in Section 11.11, “Dynamic Invocation,” on page 150
so that one doesn’t have to use underscores. For example, sysProps.java.home should
select the property with key "java.home". Use a helper class, also extending Dynamic,
that contains partially completed paths.
