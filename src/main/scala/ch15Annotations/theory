Annotations let you add information to program items. This information can be processed by the
compiler or by external tools.
• You can annotate classes, methods, fields, local variables, parameters, expressions, type
parameters, and types.
• With expressions and types, the annotation follows the annotated item.
• Annotations have the form @Annotation, @Annotation(value), or
@Annotation(name1 = value1, ...).
• @volatile, @transient, @strictfp, and @native generate the equivalent Java
modifiers.
• Use @throws to generate Java-compatible throws specifications.
• The @tailrec annotation lets you verify that a recursive function uses tail call optimization.
• The assert function takes advantage of the @elidable annotation. You can optionally
remove assertions from your Scala programs.
• Use the @deprecated annotation to mark deprecated features.
