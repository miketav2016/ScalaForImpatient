An annotation must extend the Annotation trait.
If you want to implement a new Java annotation, you need to write the annotation class in Java.
You can, of course, use that annotation for your Scala classes.

 there are six items that can be annotation targets:
• The constructor parameter
• The private instance field
• The accessor method username
• The mutator method username_=
• The bean accessor getUsername
• The bean mutator setUsername
