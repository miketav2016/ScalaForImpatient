If the annotation has no arguments, the parentheses can be omitted:
@Entity class Credentials

@Test def testSomeFeature() { ... }
this annotation is equivalent to
@Test(timeout = 0, expected = classOf[org.junit.Test.None])
def testSomeFeature() { ... }

Arguments of Java annotations are restricted to the following types:
• Numeric literals
• Strings
• Class literals
• Java enumerations
• Other annotations
• Arrays of the above (but not arrays of arrays)
Arguments of Scala annotations can be of arbitrary types, but only a couple of the Scala annotations
take advantage of this added flexibility. For instance, the @deprecatedName annotation has an
argument of type Symbol.
