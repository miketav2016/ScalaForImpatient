Annotations are tags that you insert into your source code so that some tools can process them. These
tools can operate at the source level, or they can process the class files into which the compiler has
placed your annotations.
Annotations are widely used in Java.
You can also use Scala annotations. These annotations are specific to Scala and are usually
processed by the Scala compiler or a compiler plugin.
Java annotations do not affect how the compiler translates source code into bytecode; they merely add
data to the bytecode that can be harvested by external tools. In Scala, annotations can affect the
compilation process. For example, the @BeanProperty annotation that you saw in Chapter 5
causes the generation of getter and setter methods.
