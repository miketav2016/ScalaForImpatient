Write a Scala object with a volatile Boolean field. Have one thread sleep for some time, then
set the field to true, print a message, and exit. Another thread will keep checking whether the
field is true. If so, it prints a message and exits. If not, it sleeps for a short time and tries
again. What happens if the variable is not volatile?
***
If the variable is not volatile,
then threads may see the changes to this variable with some delay,
or may not see changes at all. Since non-volatile (normal) variables may be cached.
