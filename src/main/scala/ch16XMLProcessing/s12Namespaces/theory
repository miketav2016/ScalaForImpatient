In XML, namespaces are used to avoid name clashes, similar to packages in Java or Scala. However,
an XML namespace is a URI (and usually a URL), such as
http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml

In Scala, each element has a scope property of type NamespaceBinding. The uri property of
that class yields the namespace URI.


If you want to mix elements from multiple namespaces, it is tedious to work with namespace URLs.
An alternative is a namespace prefix.
myXML1.XML
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

To find out the namespace of an element, look at the scope.uri value.
If there are multiple namespaces, they are chained together through scope.parent links
