The NodeSeq class provides methods that resemble the / and // operators in XPath.
Since // denotes comments and is therefore not a valid operator, Scala uses \ and \\ instead.
The \\ operator locates descendants at any depth. For example,
doc \\ "img"
locates all img elements anywhere inside the doc.
A string starting with @ locates attributes. For example,
img \ "@alt"
returns the value of the alt attribute of the given node, and
doc \\ "@alt"
locates all alt attributes of any elements inside doc.
***
There is no wildcard notation for attributes; img \ "@_" does not return all attributes.
***
Unlike XPath, you cannot use a single \ to extract attributes from multiple nodes. For example,
doc \\ "img" \ "@src" will not work if the document contains more than one img
element. Use doc \\ "img" \\ "@src" instead
***
The result of \ or \\ is a node sequence.
