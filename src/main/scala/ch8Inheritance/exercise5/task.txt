Define an abstract class Item with methods price and description. A SimpleItem
is an item whose price and description are specified in the constructor. Take advantage of the
fact that a val can override a def. A Bundle is an item that contains other items. Its price is
the sum of the prices in the bundle. Also provide a mechanism for adding items to the bundle
and a suitable description method.
